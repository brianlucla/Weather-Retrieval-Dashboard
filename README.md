# Weather-Retrieval-Dashboard

## Description

We are using a server side API to create an application for users to retrieve weather data from user inputted cities. Users will be able to see a 5 day forecast and the current day's weather in a very accessible format. This helped me learn how to use server side API's and dayjs as well.
